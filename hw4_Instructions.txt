Homework 4 Instructions.

In this homework assignment, we are going to create a calculator that can only do multiplication! 

This calculator will incorprate user input, functions, while loops, and if statements.
The user will be able to input two numbers and the program will tell them the answer.
However, once the user inputs -1 as a possible answer. The program ends.

Your output needs to look exactly the same as the image, "exampleOutput".

Once you have completed the assignment, you will create your own github repository, and push your completed
assignment.

Best of luck!
